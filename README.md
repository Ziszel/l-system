# L-systems

This project houses work done for university on l-systems and fractals.

## What you will need to run it

- SDL2
- Linux (Should also work on Mac and Windows, but only tested on Linux)
- GCC/G++ (You can just edit the Makefile if you use another compiler)

## Known issues

Unfortunately my code does not function as required. It will produce correct rulesets,
but will not create accurate images from those rules.
